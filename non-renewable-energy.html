        <h1>Non Renewable Energy</h1>
        <h2>What is Non-renewable Energy?</h2>
        <p>Non-renewable energy is energy sources that exist in finite quantities and cannot be naturally replenished 
            or regenerated. These energy resources are formed through natural processes, such as the decomposition of
             organic matter or the nuclear reactions occurring in the Earth’s core. Non-renewable energy plays a 
             significant role in meeting our current energy demands but poses challenges due to its finite nature 
             and environmental impact.
        </p>
        <p>Non-renewable energy has been the backbone of modern industrialization and has fueled economic growth for 
            centuries. However, the finite nature of these resources calls for the exploration and development of sustainable 
            alternatives, such as renewable energy sources like solar and wind.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Non-renewable Energy Resources</h2>
        <p>Non-renewable resources primarily consist of fuels derived from fossil deposits. Let’s explore some of the most 
            commonly utilised non-renewable energy sources:
        </p>

        <h3>Coal</h3>
        <p>Coal has long been a significant contributor to non-renewable energy production. Coal is formed from ancient 
            plants’ remains and extracted from underground mines or surface mining methods. It is widely used in electricity
             generation and industrial processes, making it a prominent non-renewable energy resource.

        <h3>Petroleum Products</h3>
        <p>Petroleum products are another essential component of non-renewable energy sources derived from crude oil.
             Crude oil is extracted from underground reservoirs and refined into various products, including gasoline, 
             diesel, jet fuel, and heating oil.

        <h3>Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)</h3>
        <p>CNG is sourced from natural gas reserves and compressed for use in vehicles, particularly in transportation 
            fleets and as a fuel for natural gas power plants. CNG is gaining popularity due to its lower emissions and 
            cost-effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p>These non-renewable energy sources provide a significant portion of our energy needs. However, it is important
             to recognize their finite nature and explore alternative energy options to ensure a sustainable future. 
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Non-renewable Energy</h2>
        <p>Non-renewable energy primarily consists of fossil fuels and nuclear fuels. Let’s explore each of these types 
            in detail:
        </p>

        <h3>Fossil Fuels</h3>
        <p>Fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals that underwent a process of decomposition
             over millions of years. They are categorized into three main types:
        </p>

        <h4>Natural Gas</h4>
        <p>Natural gas is a gaseous fossil fuel composed mainly of methane. It is often found in association with oil deposits.
             Natural gas is a versatile energy source used for heating, cooking, electricity generation, and as a fuel for
              vehicles.
        </p>

        <h4>Coal</h4>
        <p>Coal is a solid fossil fuel that forms when plant material, such as trees, plants, and ferns, undergoes decomposition 
            under high pressure and heat over millions of years. It is primarily used for electricity generation in power plants 
            and is known for its significant carbon content.
        </p>

        <h4>Oil</h4>
        <p>Oil is a liquid fossil fuel that results from the decomposition of smaller organisms like zooplankton and algae, which were
             subjected to immense pressure over time. Oil is a crucial energy resource used in transportation, manufacturing, 
             and producing various petrochemical products.
        </p>

        <h3>Nuclear Fuels</h3>
        <p>Nuclear fuels are utilised in nuclear power plants, where energy is generated through nuclear fission. The most commonly
             used nuclear fuel is uranium, found in the Earth’s crust in relatively low concentrations. Uranium undergoes fission
              reactions, releasing large amounts of energy.
        </p>
        <p>Understanding the significance of both fossil fuels and nuclear fuels as non-renewable energy sources is important. 
            While they have played a crucial role in meeting our energy demands, their extraction, use, and environmental impact
             must be carefully managed.
