        <h1>Renewable Energy</h1>
        <h2>What is renewable energy?</h2>
        <p>Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate than
             they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that are constantly being 
             replenished. Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us.
        </p>
        <p>Fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - on the other hand, are non-renewable resources that take hundreds 
            of millions of years to form. Fossil fuels, when burned to produce energy, cause harmful greenhouse 
            gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide.
        </p>
        <p>Generating renewable energy creates far lower emissions than burning fossil fuels. Transitioning from
             fossil fuels, which currently account for the lion’s share of emissions, to renewable energy is key 
             to addressing the climate crisis.
        </p>
        <p>Renewables are now cheaper in most countries, and generate three times more jobs than fossil fuels.
        </p>

        <h3>Here are a few common sources of renewable energy:</h3>
        <img src="./img/solar-energy.png">
        <h4>SOLAR ENERGY</h4>
        <p>Solar energy is the most abundant of all energy resources and can even be harnessed in cloudy weather.
             The rate at which solar energy is intercepted by the Earth is about 10,000 times greater than the rate 
             at which humankind consumes energy.
        </p>
        <p>Solar technologies can deliver heat, cooling, natural lighting, electricity, and fuels for a host of applications. 
            Solar technologies convert sunlight into electrical energy either through photovoltaic panels or through mirrors 
            that concentrate solar radiation.
        </p>
        <p>Although not all countries are equally endowed with solar energy, a significant contribution to the energy mix from
             direct solar energy is possible for every country.
        </p>
        <p>The cost of manufacturing solar panels has plummeted dramatically in the last decade, making them not only affordable
             but often the cheapest form of electricity. Solar panels have a lifespan of roughly 30 years, and come in variety of 
             shades depending on the type of material used in manufacturing.
        </p>

         <img src="./img/wind-energy.jpg" alt="your image">
        <h4>WIND ENERGY</h4>
        <p>Wind energy harnesses the kinetic energy of moving air by using large wind turbines located on land (onshore) or in 
            sea- or freshwater (offshore). Wind energy has been used for millennia, but onshore and offshore wind energy 
            technologies have evolved over the last few years to maximize the electricity produced - with taller turbines 
            and larger rotor diameters.
        </p>
        <p>Though average wind speeds vary considerably by location, the world’s technical potential for wind energy 
            exceeds global electricity production, and ample potential exists in most regions of the world to enable 
            significant wind energy deployment.
        </p>
        <p>Many parts of the world have strong wind speeds, but the best locations for generating wind power are 
            sometimes remote ones. Offshore wind power offers tremendous potential.
        </p>

        <img src="./img/geothermal-energy.png">
        <h4>GEOTHERMAL ENERGY</h4>
        <p>Geothermal energy utilizes the accessible thermal energy from the Earth’s interior. Heat is extracted from
             geothermal reservoirs using wells or other means.
        </p>
        <p>Reservoirs that are naturally sufficiently hot and permeable are called hydrothermal reservoirs, whereas reservoirs
             that are sufficiently hot but that are improved with hydraulic stimulation are called enhanced geothermal systems.
        </p>
        <p>Once at the surface, fluids of various temperatures can be used to generate electricity. The technology for 
            electricity generation from hydrothermal reservoirs is mature and reliable, and has been operating for more 
            than 100 years.
        </p>

        <img src="./img/hydropower-energy.png">
        <h4>HYDROPOWER</h4>
        <p>Hydropower harnesses the energy of water moving from higher to lower elevations. It can be generated from reservoirs 
            and rivers. Reservoir hydropower plants rely on stored water in a reservoir, while run-of-river hydropower plants 
            harness energy from the available flow of the river.
        </p>
        <p>Hydropower reservoirs often have multiple uses - providing drinking water, water for irrigation, flood and drought 
            control, navigation services, as well as energy supply.
        </p>
        <p>Hydropower currently is the largest source of renewable energy in the electricity sector. It relies on generally 
            stable rainfall patterns, and can be negatively impacted by climate-induced droughts or changes to ecosystems 
            which impact rainfall patterns.
        </p>
        <p>The infrastructure needed to create hydropower can also impact on ecosystems in adverse ways. For this reason,  
            many consider small-scale hydro a more environmentally-friendly option, and especially suitable for communities
             in remote locations.
        </p>

        <img src="./img/ocean-energy.png">
        <h4>OCEAN ENERGY</h4>
        <p>Ocean energy derives from technologies that use the kinetic and thermal energy of seawater - waves or currents 
            for instance -  to produce electricity or heat.
        </p>
        <p>Ocean energy systems are still at an early stage of development, with a number of prototype wave and tidal current 
            devices being explored. The theoretical potential for ocean energy easily exceeds present human energy requirements.
        </p>

        <img src="./img/bio-energy.png">
        <h4>BIOENERGY</h4>
        <p>Bioenergy is produced from a variety of organic materials, called biomass, such as wood, charcoal, dung and other
             manures for heat and power production, and agricultural crops for liquid biofuels. Most biomass is used in rural 
             areas for cooking, lighting and space heating, generally by poorer populations in developing countries.
        </p>
        <p>Modern biomass systems include dedicated crops or trees, residues from agriculture and forestry, and various organic
         waste streams.
        </p>
        <p>Energy created by burning biomass creates greenhouse gas emissions, but at lower levels than burning fossil fuels 
            like coal, oil or gas. However, bioenergy should only be used in limited applications, given potential negative 
            environmental impacts related to large-scale increases in forest and bioenergy plantations, and resulting 
            deforestation and land-use change.
