        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>What is energy?</h2>
        <h3>Energy is the ability to do work</h3>
        <p>Scientists define energy as the ability to do work. Modern civilization is possible because
            people have learned how to change energy from one form to another and then use it to do work. 
            People use energy for a variety of things, such as to walk and bicycle, to move cars along 
            roads and boats through water, to cook food on stoves, to make ice in freezers, to light our 
            homes and offices, to manufacture products, and to send astronauts into space.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>There are many forms of energy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat</li>
            <li>Light</li>
            <li>Motion</li>
            <li>Electrical</li>
            <li>Chemical</li>
            <li>Gravitational</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These <span>forms of energy</span> can be grouped into two general types of energy for doing work:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Potential, or stored, energy</li>
            <li>Kinetic, or working, energy</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span> Energy can be converted</span> from one form to another. For example, the food you eat contains 
            chemical energy, and your body stores this energy until you use it as kinetic energy during 
            work or play. The stored chemical energy in coal or natural gas and the kinetic energy of 
            water flowing in rivers can be converted to electrical energy, which can be converted to 
            light and heat.
        </p>
        <h3>Energy sources are renewable or nonrenewable</h3>
        <p>There are many different sources of energy, but they can all be divided into two categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Renewable energy sources</li>
            <li>Nonrenewable energy sources</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Renewable and nonrenewable energy sources can be used as primary energy sources to produce useful 
            energy such as heat, or they can be used to produce secondary energy sources such as electricity
            and hydrogen.
