        <h2>Different Types of Energy</h2>
        <p>Although there are many forms of energy, it is broadly categorized into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Potential Energy</li>
            <li>Kinetic Energy </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Potential Energy</h3>
        <p>Potential energy, stored energy that depends upon the relative position of 
            various parts of a system. A spring has more potential energy when it is 
            compressed or stretched. A steel ball has more potential energy raised above
            the ground than it has after falling to Earth. In the raised position it is 
            capable of doing more work. Potential energy is a property of a system and 
            not of an individual body or particle; the system composed of Earth and the
            raised ball, for example, has more potential energy as the two are farther separated.
        </p>
        <h3>Kinetic Energy</h3>
        <p>Kinetic energy, form of energy that an object or a particle has by reason of its motion. 
            If work, which transfers energy, is done on an object by applying a net force, the 
            object speeds up and thereby gains kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is a property of
            a moving object or particle and depends not only on its motion but also on its mass. 
            The kind of motion may be translation (or motion along a path from one place to another),
            rotation about an axis, vibration, or any combination of motions.
